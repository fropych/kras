3D Gaussian splatting models, as a novel explicit 3D representation, have been applied in many domains recently, such as explicit geometric editing and geometry generation. Progress has been rapid. However, due to their mixed scales and cluttered shapes, 3D Gaussian splatting models can produce a blurred or needle-like effect near the surface. At the same time, 3D Gaussian splatting models tend to flatten large untextured regions, yielding a very sparse point cloud. These problems are caused by the non-uniform nature of 3D Gaussian splatting models, so in this paper, we propose a new 3D Gaussian splitting algorithm, which can produce a more uniform and surface-bounded 3D Gaussian splatting model. Our algorithm splits an N-dimensional Gaussian into two N-dimensional Gaussians. It ensures consistency of mathematical characteristics and similarity of appearance, allowing resulting 3D Gaussian splatting models to be more uniform and a better fit to the underlying surface, and thus more suitable for explicit editing, point cloud extraction and other tasks. Meanwhile, our 3D Gaussian splitting approach has a very simple closed-form solution, making it readily applicable to any 3D Gaussian model.

With the rising popularity of 3D Gaussian splatting and the expanse of applications from rendering to 3D reconstruction, there comes also a need for geometry processing applications directly on this new representation. While considering the centers of Gaussians as a point cloud or meshing them is an option that allows to apply existing algorithms, this might ignore information present in the data or be unnecessarily expensive. Additionally, Gaussian splatting tends to contain a large number of outliers which do not affect the rendering quality but need to be handled correctly in order not to produce noisy results in geometry processing applications. In this work, we propose a formulation to compute the Laplace-Beltrami operator, a widely used tool in geometry processing, directly on Gaussian splatting using the Mahalanobis distance. While conceptually similar to a point cloud Laplacian, our experiments show superior accuracy on the point clouds encoded in the Gaussian splatting centers and, additionally, the operator can be used to evaluate the quality of the output during optimization.

3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS) have proven a versatile rendering primitive, both for inverse rendering as well as real-time exploration of scenes. In these applications, coherence across camera frames and multiple views is crucial, be it for robust convergence of a scene reconstruction or for artifact-free fly-throughs. Recent work started mitigating artifacts that break multi-view coherence, including popping artifacts due to inconsistent transparency sorting and perspective-correct outlines of (2D) splats. At the same time, real-time requirements forced such implementations to accept compromises in how transparency of large assemblies of 3D Gaussians is resolved, in turn breaking coherence in other ways. In our work, we aim at achieving maximum coherence, by rendering fully perspective-correct 3D Gaussians while using a high-quality approximation of accurate blending, hybrid transparency, on a per-pixel level, in order to retain real-time frame rates. Our fast and perspectively accurate approach for evaluation of 3D Gaussians does not require matrix inversions, thereby ensuring numerical stability and eliminating the need for special handling of degenerate splats, and the hybrid transparency formulation for blending maintains similar quality as fully resolved per-pixel transparencies at a fraction of the rendering costs. We further show that each of these two components can be independently integrated into Gaussian splatting systems. In combination, they achieve up to 2× higher frame rates, 2× faster optimization, and equal or better image quality with fewer rendering artifacts compared to traditional 3DGS on common benchmarks.

Gaussian Splatting (GS) is a recent and pivotal technique in 3D computer graphics. GS-based algorithms almost always bypass classical methods such as ray tracing, which offers numerous inherent advantages for rendering. For example, ray tracing is able to handle incoherent rays for advanced lighting effects, including shadows and reflections. To address this limitation, we introduce MeshSplats, a method which converts GS to a mesh-like format. Following the completion of training, MeshSplats transforms Gaussian elements into mesh faces, enabling rendering using ray tracing methods with all their associated benefits. Our model can be utilized immediately following transformation, yielding a mesh of slightly reduced quality without additional training. Furthermore, we can enhance the reconstruction quality through the application of a dedicated optimization algorithm that operates on mesh faces rather than Gaussian components. The efficacy of our method is substantiated by experimental results, underscoring its extensive applications in computer graphics and image processing.

In this paper, we introduce Textured-GS, an innovative method for rendering Gaussian splatting that incorporates spatially defined color and opacity variations using Spherical Harmonics (SH). This approach enables each Gaussian to exhibit a richer representation by accommodating varying colors and opacities across its surface, significantly enhancing rendering quality compared to traditional methods. To demonstrate the merits of our approach, we have adapted the Mini-Splatting architecture to integrate textured Gaussians without increasing the number of Gaussians. Our experiments across multiple real-world datasets show that Textured-GS consistently outperforms both the baseline Mini-Splatting and standard 3DGS in terms of visual fidelity. The results highlight the potential of Textured-GS to advance Gaussian-based rendering technologies, promising more efficient and high-quality scene reconstructions. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/ZhentaoHuang/Textured-GS.

Gaussian Splattings demonstrate impressive results in multi-view reconstruction based on Gaussian explicit representations. However, the current Gaussian primitives only have a single view-dependent color and an opacity to represent the appearance and geometry of the scene, resulting in a non-compact representation. In this paper, we introduce a new method called SuperGaussians that utilizes spatially varying colors and opacity in a single Gaussian primitive to improve its representation ability. We have implemented bilinear interpolation, movable kernels, and even tiny neural networks as spatially varying functions. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that all three functions outperform the baseline, with the best movable kernels achieving superior novel view synthesis performance on multiple datasets, highlighting the strong potential of spatially varying functions.

The 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gained its popularity recently by combining the advantages of both primitive-based and volumetric 3D representations, resulting in improved quality and efficiency for 3D scene rendering. However, 3DGS is not alias-free, and its rendering at varying resolutions could produce severe blurring or jaggies. This is because 3DGS treats each pixel as an isolated, single point rather than as an area, causing insensitivity to changes in the footprints of pixels. Consequently, this discrete sampling scheme inevitably results in aliasing, owing to the restricted sampling bandwidth. In this paper, we derive an analytical solution to address this issue. More specifically, we use a conditioned logistic function as the analytic approximation of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) in a one-dimensional Gaussian signal and calculate the Gaussian integral by subtracting the CDFs. We then introduce this approximation in the two-dimensional pixel shading, and present Analytic-Splatting, which analytically approximates the Gaussian integral within the 2D-pixel window area to better capture the intensity response of each pixel. Moreover, we use the approximated response of the pixel window integral area to participate in the transmittance calculation of volume rendering, making Analytic-Splatting sensitive to the changes in pixel footprint at different resolutions. Experiments on various datasets validate that our approach has better anti-aliasing capability that gives more details and better fidelity.

Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a prominent model for constructing 3D representations from images across diverse domains. However, the efficiency of the 3D Gaussian Splatting rendering pipeline relies on several simplifications. Notably, reducing Gaussian to 2D splats with a single view-space depth introduces popping and blending artifacts during view rotation. Addressing this issue requires accurate per-pixel depth computation, yet a full per-pixel sort proves excessively costly compared to a global sort operation. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical rasterization approach that systematically resorts and culls splats with minimal processing overhead. Our software rasterizer effectively eliminates popping artifacts and view inconsistencies, as demonstrated through both quantitative and qualitative measurements. Simultaneously, our method mitigates the potential for cheating view-dependent effects with popping, ensuring a more authentic representation. Despite the elimination of cheating, our approach achieves comparable quantitative results for test images, while increasing the consistency for novel view synthesis in motion. Due to its design, our hierarchical approach is only 4% slower on average than the original Gaussian Splatting. Notably, enforcing consistency enables a reduction in the number of Gaussians by approximately half with nearly identical quality and view-consistency. Consequently, rendering performance is nearly doubled, making our approach 1.6x faster than the original Gaussian Splatting, with a 50% reduction in memory requirements.

Radiance Field methods have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos or videos. However, achieving high visual quality still requires neural networks that are costly to train and render, while recent faster methods inevitably trade off speed for quality. For unbounded and complete scenes (rather than isolated objects) and 1080p resolution rendering, no current method can achieve real-time display rates. We introduce three key elements that allow us to achieve state-of-the-art visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and importantly allow high-quality real-time (>= 30 fps) novel-view synthesis at 1080p resolution. First, starting from sparse points produced during camera calibration, we represent the scene with 3D Gaussians that preserve desirable properties of continuous volumetric radiance fields for scene optimization while avoiding unnecessary computation in empty space; Second, we perform interleaved optimization/density control of the 3D Gaussians, notably optimizing anisotropic covariance to achieve an accurate representation of the scene; Third, we develop a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm that supports anisotropic splatting and both accelerates training and allows realtime rendering. We demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several established datasets.

Gaussian Splatting (GS) has become one of the most important neural rendering algorithms. GS represents 3D scenes using Gaussian components with trainable color and opacity. This representation achieves high-quality renderings with fast inference. Regrettably, it is challenging to integrate such a solution with varying light conditions, including shadows and light reflections, manual adjustments, and a physical engine. Recently, a few approaches have appeared that incorporate ray-tracing or mesh primitives into GS to address some of these caveats. However, no such solution can simultaneously solve all the existing limitations of the classical GS. Consequently, we introduce REdiSplats, which employs ray tracing and a mesh-based representation of flat 3D Gaussians. In practice, we model the scene using flat Gaussian distributions parameterized by the mesh. We can leverage fast ray tracing and control Gaussian modification by adjusting the mesh vertices. Moreover, REdiSplats allows modeling of light conditions, manual adjustments, and physical simulation. Furthermore, we can render our models using 3D tools such as Blender or Nvdiffrast, which opens the possibility of integrating them with all existing 3D graphics techniques dedicated to mesh representations.

Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D reconstruction, it still faces challenges such as aliasing, projection artifacts, and view inconsistencies, primarily due to the simplification of treating splats as 2D entities. We argue that incorporating full 3D evaluation of Gaussians throughout the 3DGS pipeline can effectively address these issues while preserving rasterization efficiency. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive 3D smoothing filter to mitigate aliasing and present a stable view-space bounding method that eliminates popping artifacts when Gaussians extend beyond the view frustum. Furthermore, we promote tile-based culling to 3D with screen-space planes, accelerating rendering and reducing sorting costs for hierarchical rasterization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art quality on in-distribution evaluation sets and significantly outperforms other approaches for out-of-distribution views. Our qualitative evaluations further demonstrate the effective removal of aliasing, distortions, and popping artifacts, ensuring real-time, artifact-free rendering.
